# Advanced API

This API allows a user to login and view a library of books and create their own personalized reading list. The task is to make improvements to structure, efficiency, and functionality. 

## Structure
* Added a separate module which holds all calls to the API.

* Added module to include all functions relating to books.

* Added module to include all login/registration commands. 

## Efficiency
Created a function that retrieves a book by its id. There was code written several times and this function returns the result. This reduces the need to filter through all books each time it is called.

## Functionality
* Added the ability to delete a user
* Added the ability to edit user details
* Added several custom messages including the user's name


## Feedback
Any feedback on this project is greatly appreciated.
